## About

[Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) My name is Matt Packer. I am an aspiring software engineer, and this is my first major web development project. I am completing this project as part of [General Assembly](https://www.generalassemb.ly)'s intense Software Engineering Immersive program that I am a fellow in.

The assigned task was to create a web-based application that is a 'game', in order to help me learn to think more like a programmer. This project gave me an opportunity to be creative and to solve problems while encountering some difficult programming challenges.

I hope you enjoy my 'Mega Man' themed JavaScript Slot Machine game!


## Getting Started

My game was deployed using Surge, and can be found here: https://mp-js-slot-machine-project.surge.sh/

![JS Slot Machine Screen Shots](images/mmSlots_Screenshots.png)

* The game was created using a 'moblie-first' design and is responsive so that renders at a smaller or larger size depending on the screen size.


## Technical Summary

* Technology used in development:
  * JavaScript - ES6
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Git
  * GitHub
  * Surge

## App Requirement Summary

* Define the required constants.
  
* Define the required variables to track the state of the game.
  
* Store the elements on the page that will be accessed in the code more than once as variables.
  
* Upon loading, the game should:
  * Initialize the game state variables.
  * Render those values on the page.
  * Wait for the user to press the spin button to play the game.
  
* Handle a player clicking the spin button.
  
* Handle a player clicking the reset button.


## Game Summary

* Display a slot machine layout when the webpage loads. This includes:
  
  * Body of the machine.

  * Three boxes where the 'reels' will display values based on random numbers generated, and predetermined odds for each potential value ('Payout' for 3-in-a-row of each element):
    * eTank (50 credits) - most common
    * Met (100 credits)
    * Proto Man (250 credits)
    * Dr. Wily (500 credits)
    * Mega Man (Jackpot - 1000 credits) - least common

  * Display credits remaining (start with 10 - 1 credit will be used each time the player spins the reels).

  * Display the number of credits won on a spin (payouts for 3-in-a-row).

  * Button to spin the 'reels' and play the game.

  * Reset button to reload the game to the initial state.

* HOW TO PLAY:
  * This is a game of chance.
  * When the 'SPIN' button is pressed the reels 'spin' and three images appear randomly in the 'reel' boxes.
  * The objective is to get three matching images, and to avoid running out of credits.
  * To play, press the 'SPIN' button.
  * 1 credit will be deducted for each spin.
  * If 0 credits remain, use the 'RESET' button to reset the game to the original state and try again.
